## Overviews* Visual Analytics vs Numerical Analytics* Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate* Simple summarization/aggregation vs more complex statistical analysis### Birvaritate* Searching for a relationship between two variables (if one exists)* Simplest type of statistics. Apart from univariate (= one variable!)* Covering the basic principles and characteristics of this analysis### Independent / Dependent variables* In any experiment you have (at least):    - one independent variable    - one dependent variable    - everything else controlled    * **For instance**, to establish the effect of temperature on the rate of plant growth:        - Temperature is the independent variable        - Growth is the dependent variable        - Which could be height, weight, number of fruits, etc### Bivariate analysis of discrete variables: contingency tables* Summarise information about discrete variables using contingency tables:    * _“A matrix that shows the frequency distribution of the two variables being correlated”_    * Also known as a “cross tabulation”    * Shows the number of observations for each combination of discrete values from two categorical     variables.    * Categorical values can be ordinal or nominal    * Continuous values must be made discrete (categorised)> ### E.g.#### Contingency table example: population countYEAR VS STATEcells are count of resident (total population)> ![C-29140065-BE41-4ADF-9380-CE1B11039BC3.png](resources/D6D9EB948AFE44F2D51DCD1CE8905CD4.png)### Pivot table> ### E.g#### Pivot tables: visualisation of the contingenciesCITY VS MONTHcells are average of mean max temperature![C-F3F389BB-14F3-47C3-A6E1-BDB226EE9C33.png](resources/C0663DA648B07B3105FF43E7193B0069.png)* Pivot tables allow quick creation of contingencies* Can change the order of variables and see the changes (hence “pivot” due to the rotation of the variables)* Automatically sorts, totals or averages counts within a (tabulated) data-set### Analysing discrete variables: rank correlation* Rank correlation    * Calculates similarities between ranks![C-46BDD46F-B254-4059-A5DC-7237032CE3DE.png](resources/B587A49A31CB2281ACBF33B74AE0ADC3.png)### E.g> ![C-737950DE-29D8-4343-A09C-2696A30C32DB.png](resources/A6572F72B5A00CC6E0C65FFBEE2C59A3.png)$d^2 = 8, n = 6$    $ p = 1 - (6 * 8 ) / (6(36-1))$* Relatively high value (nearer + 1) suggests yes, there is a relationship### Bivariate analysis of continuous variables* RegressionThe concept that in the long-term, extreme measurements of a continuous variable will converge on a single “average” relationship* Pearson correlation coefficientThe degree of relationship between two continuous variables> ### E.g> Good Example![C-7C4AC597-A851-4E8F-B2F2-980CA1130014.png](resources/106A14056FF458729BF5C0E3A285BFC1.png)> Bad Example![C-51AD9D51-6B25-4A03-A545-66B9377427F4.png](resources/8048B72A52DF8CA553BBF3FD342C5BD4.png)The idea is that there is a defined meaning of “normal” of this data-set, and in a good model the data points are never very far from “normal”i.e. they “regress to the mean”…### Linear RegressionFor instance, the rate of plant growth is the relationship between the independent and dependent variables:* Growth = [some number] * Temperature* Where [some number] is the correlation co-efficient> ### E.g.![C-3C2CE385-CEB0-480B-BD22-E85497B604A8.png](resources/E5B1BBC665219D52D0948590A0E90627.png)### Pearson correlation coefficient![C-D51F7225-AC76-480E-8C34-37934F38066E.png](resources/C25A32922D9DCA8DDA66642BD93B1739.png)**<p style="text-align: center;">(inverse correlation) -1 <= r <= 1 (positive correlation)r = 0 (no correlation)</p>**![C-BAC4B3C1-E801-49BC-8657-8E1EE7F9A8BF.png](resources/ED969C1D371C9997395379C382C952C0.png)
