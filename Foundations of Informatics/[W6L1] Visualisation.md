## Visualization is
a mapping from **data variables** to **visual variables**

* Way of seeing meaning/relationships in data – prosthetic to our mental models
* Visualisations amplify cognition
* Visualisations provide a space for exploring data
* **Exploratory and explanatory**
    * “discover the unexpected; describe and explain the expected”

## Data variables
* Continuous and discrete variables

    * Continuous 
    Numerical or quantitative (Mackinlay, 2086) Numbers or anything that can have a range 
    * Discrete 
    Anything else

* Discrete/categorical

    * Ordinal 
    Ordered/ranked set Example: (N, P, H3, H2B, H2A, H1) 
    * Nominal Unordered set 
    Examples: (sydney,melbourne,perth,...) and (male,female)
    

## Data variables - Steven’s Types (Scales)
* Nominal scale 
* Ordinal scale 
* Interval scale
    * Has no meaningful zero point (no origin) 
    * Express difference (interval) between two measurements 
    * Examples: dates (AD), latitude 
    * Celcius temperature scale 
    * To say that "2°C temperature is twice as hot as 1°C" is NOT meaningful 
* Ratio scale
    * Has a meaningful, unique and non-arbitrary zero point. 
    * Examples: mass, length, duration, angle. 
    * Kelvin temperature scale contains absolute zero point. 
    * It is meaningful to say that "a 2-metre object has "twice the length" of a 1- metre object"

## Functions of Visualisation
* Associative function 
grouping of all correspondences differentiated by a variable 
perceived as **similar** 
* Selective function 
isolation of correspondences differentiated by a variable 
perceived as **different**, forming families 
* Ordering function a spontaneous visual perception of rank 
perceived as **ordered** 
* Quantitative function a visual difference between two categories expressed as a numerical ratio 
perceived as **proportional**
